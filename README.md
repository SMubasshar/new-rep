This code is written for the Stokes flow passing through a number of circular obstacles. The code is not yet in the ideal form. I keep updating it. To run the code, clone the repository by using the GitHub URL. Then, enter the new-rep by using the cd command and run the file by using the command 
python Stokes_flow.py
